# GA-ImageBot
ImageBot is a bot that randomly creates images and attempts to recreate one as closely as it can to the original by using a genetic algorithm.

## How it works
1. The bot starts by generating a population of randomly generated images (about 10 000).

2. It then associates a fitness to the images, a percentage on how close it is from the original image.

3. The bot then breeds asexually the highest fitness image and repeats 2 and 3 forever
