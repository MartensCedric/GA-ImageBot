# GA-ImageBot
ImageBot is a bot that randomly creates images and attempts to recreate one as closely as it can to the original by using a genetic algorithm.

## How it works
1. The bot starts by generating a population of randomly generated images sharing the same dimensions with the original.

2. It associates a fitness to the all the new images : a percentage on how close it is from the original image.

3. The bot then asexually breeds the highest fitness image and repeats 2 and 3.
